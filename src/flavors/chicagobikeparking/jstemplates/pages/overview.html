<p>CDOT works hard to consistently serve bicyclists throughout the City by installing roughly 500 bike racks on city sidewalks each year. You can help us locate the best places for these racks by using this map to put in a request where more bike parking is needed. CDOT will review your request in the field looking for sites on the public right-of-way that don’t interfere with pedestrian travel and are clear of other street furniture. Our criteria for new rack placement, including examples of where we generally do and do not install racks, are listed in detail at <a href="http://chicagocompletestreets.org/your-streets/bike-parking/faq/" target="_blank">chicagocompletestreets.org</a>. While we try to conduct field surveys as promptly as possible, the process can sometimes take several months. If we are able to approve your request, the icon on this page will be updated and a rack will be installed within four weeks. Many factors influence if and when a bike rack can be installed, so the date and time of installation cannot be guaranteed.</p>
