<h2>Tell us where you see abandoned bikes.</h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The CDOT Bike Parking Program removes abandoned bikes locked to city-owned racks and street furniture. This work is done in compliance with Section 9-52-071 of the Chicago Municipal Code, which states, in part:</p>
<ul style="list-style:lower-alpha;margin-bottom:0;font-size:0.875em;padding-left:2em;">
  <li>It shall be unlawful for any person to abandon any bicycle on any public way within the city. A bicycle shall be deemed abandoned if it:
    <ul style="list-style:decimal;margin-bottom:0;padding-left:2em;">
      <li>is in such a state of disrepair as to be incapable of being operated in its present condition, or</li>
      <li>has not been moved or used in more than seven days and bears physical indicia of having been deserted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>You can report abandoned bikes on city-owned racks and street furniture using this map.</h5>

<p>CDOT will tag bikes that appear to be abandoned and, if they are not claimed within seven days, remove them. These bicycles are then held for at least one month before being donated to Working Bikes, a not-for-profit organization that repairs landfill-bound bicycles to working condition and sells them to Chicagoans at a low cost in order to fund shipments of bicycles and parts to developing countries.</p>

<p><small>If you believe your bike may have been erroneously tagged and removed as an abandoned bicycle, please <a href="mailto:kmurphy@samschwartz.com">contact us</a> and include a full description of your bicycle along with the location where it was last locked.</small></p>
